# Satellites_Market_study

Final project Ironhack, Market study on satellite specs evolution &amp; cost-driven model on interplanetary missions


This project has 2 parts:

## 1-  Descriptive analysis on the satellites orbiting the Earth:
    - Measure and weight evolution
    - Evolution of Launches per year 
    - Evolution of amount of satellites launched per launch
    - Source:  UCS Satellite Database by Union of concerned Scientists
              https://www.ucsusa.org/resources/satellite-database
              
    - About the dataset : The database is updated three times a year. 
      The database contains 28 types of data for each satellite, including technical information about each satellite 
      (mass, power, launch date, expected lifetime) and its orbit (apogee, perigee, inclination, and period), 
      as well as information on what the satellite is used for, and who owns, operates, and built the satellite.
        
    
## 2- Modelisation of cost-driven specifications on inter-planetary missions
    - Goal: Predict the cost of an interplanetary satellite-mission based on its specifications/instruments
    - based on the current 43 European, American and Japanese missions specs and public cost records
    - Database with public cost information gathered by an ESA space study manager
