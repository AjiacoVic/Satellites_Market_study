# Satellites_Market_study

Final project Ironhack, Market study on satellite specs evolution &amp; cost-driven model on interplanetary missions


This project has 2 parts:

## 1-  Descriptive analysis on the satellites orbiting the Earth:
    - Measure and weight evolution
    - Evolution of Launches per year 
    - Evolution of amount of satellites launched per launch
    -Source:  UCS Satellite Database by Union of concerned Scientists

## 2- Modelisation of cost-driven specifications on inter-planetary missions
    - Goal: Predict the cost of an interplanetary satellite-mission based on its specifications/instruments
    - based on the current 43 European, American and Japanese missions specs and public cost records
    - Database with public cost information gathered by an ESA space study manager
